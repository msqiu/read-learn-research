# Object detection in RGB-D images

## important paper review

### [Learning Rich Features from RGB-D Images for Object Detection and Segmentation(ECCV'14)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5736)

On the basis of the 2D target detection framework R-CNN, add a module that utilizes Depth Map(encode the depth image with three channels at each pixel: horizontal disparity, height above ground, and the angle the pixelâ€™s local surface normal makes with the inferred gravity direction).

1. Based on RGB image and Depth Map, detect the contour in the image, and generate 2.5D proposals (as can be seen from the overview, the so-called 2.5D actually includes the parallax, height and tilt angle of each pixel of the target)

2. Use CNN for feature extraction. The network here includes two: Depth CNN learns features on the depth map, RGB CNN learns features on 2D images, and finally uses SVM for classification.
